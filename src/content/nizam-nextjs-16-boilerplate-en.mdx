Introducing my new Next.js 16 boilerplate for building modern web applications quickly, securely, and enjoyably: Nizam.

![Nizam - Next.js 16 Boilerplate](/blog/2025-11-05/nizam.png)

## Why "Nizam"?

"Nizam" means order, structure, and harmony in Turkish. Exactly what we expect from a boilerplate: well-organized, understandable, and scalable foundation. It's also a memorable name that international developers can easily pronounce. The project's name perfectly aligns with its philosophy.

## Why the renewal?

After the experience with the previous version (Next.js 15), I rebuilt the architecture from scratch with the innovations brought by Next.js 16 and React 19, making it leaner and more focused. I removed dependencies like Storybook and Sentry that might not be needed in every project from the core; they're now optional. This way, the boilerplate offers a lightweight core that's "immediately suitable" for most projects, while those who need them can easily integrate them.

## What comes with Nizam

- **Next.js 16 App Router**: File-based routing, server-first patterns, concurrency-friendly architecture.
- **Type safety and env validation**: Runtime-validated environment variables with `TypeScript 5`, `Zod`, and `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`.
- **Data layer**: Smart caching, background revalidation, and powerful mutation flows with `TanStack Query 5`.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Locale-aware routing and translation files with `next-intl`.
- **Theme and UI**: Accessible and fast interfaces with `Tailwind CSS v4` + `shadcn/ui`; light/dark theme with `next-themes`.
- **State management**: `Zustand` for lightweight global state.
- **Developer experience**: `ESLint 9`, `Prettier 3`, `Husky`, `lint-staged`, `Knip`; absolute imports (`@/`), bundle analyzer, and SEO helpers.

You can see the details of these features both in the live demo and in the README.

## What's different from the previous version?

- **Updated stack**: `Next.js 16` + `React 19`, `Tailwind CSS v4`, `TanStack Query 5`, and modern toolsets.
- **Env and security**: Type-safe and runtime-validated env variables with `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` + `Zod`.
- **Standards and rules**: Clarified new alias usage, file naming, and code writing conventions; standardized editor/AI flow with `.cursor/rules`.
- **Sustainable repo hygiene**: Clean, traceable versioning and maintenance experience with `Conventional Commits`, `Knip`, and automations.
- **Leaner core built from scratch**: Parts that "might not be in every FE project" like `Storybook/Sentry` were removed from the core; those who want them can easily add them.

## Why should you use Nizam?

- **Quick start, minimal hassle**: A core suitable for most projects, opinionated but not imposing.
- **Powerful yet simple**: A foundation that prioritizes performance, a11y, and DX, free from unnecessary dependencies.
- **Clear rules, consistent code**: Naming, aliases, and conventions bring discipline to the project; its value increases as the team grows.
- **Real-world ready**: Blocks that are "usually needed" like i18n, theme, SEO, and data layer come ready.
